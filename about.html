      <div>
        <h2 style="font-style: italic;">The Story of AutoDan</h2>
        <p>
          AutoDan was born from a simple yet powerful idea: to bridge the gap
          between everyday drivers and the world of automobiles. It all started
          when our founder, an engineer with an insatiable love for cars,
          realized that too much of the car-buying process was shrouded in
          confusion and marketing fluff. Determined to bring transparency and
          excitement to the auto world, AutoDan was created as a place where
          knowledge meets passion.
